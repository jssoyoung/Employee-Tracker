## Installation

The user will first be required to have a command-line application downloaded onto their computer or laptop. The user must also have node.js installed onto that device. Once they have these two downloaded, the user could type "npm i" into their terminal or window. This should install the dotenv, inquirer, and mysql package into the user's command-line application. Once these packages are finished being installed, the user can type in "node server.js". The user could then answer all of the questions within the command line to view or manage the department, roles, and employees in the company.

## Usage

Once the user has node.js installed into their computer or laptop, they could open their terminal or window and proceed to type in "npm i" to install all the packages and then type in "node server.js" as mentioned above. The command-line application will begin by asking the user to choose what they would like to do. The user will be presented with a list to choose from: view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee. Based on the user input, they user will either be presented with a table with all of the departments, roles, and employees names or will be asked additional questions to add to the database. If the user chooses to add a department, role, employee, or update an employee, all of the user inputs will be stored into the database. After the user is done with any of the options, they will be brought back to the first question asking what they would like to do again.
